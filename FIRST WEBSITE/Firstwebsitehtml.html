    <h2 class = "middleBox">About Dungeons and Dragons</h2>
    <p>Dungeons and Dragons (<em>DND 5e</em>) is a Tabletop RPG, a game in which people roleplay as characters in a world narated by a Dungeon Master, and every action they make is determined success by the roll of a dice.</p>
    <h3  class = "middleBox" >Making a character</h3>
    <p>In order to make a character, one has to do a few things. First, choose a Race, What species you wish to play. Then choose a class, what do you wish to be good and and what abilities do you have. And thirdly, make a backstory as a way to understand how to play your character. Not that this is a very simple version of making a character, and that this is for show purpose. Below will be the options.</p>
    <!--Races in order-->
    <h3  class = "middleBox" id="races">Races</h3>
    <ul class = "listBlock">
      <li>Dwarf</li>
      <li>Elf</li>

      <li>Tiefling</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class = "middleBox">Races Continued</h3>
    <p>Above are the basic races found in the players handbook, in which they go into great detail describing each race and their subsidies. I recommend getting one to play the game, or looking at the free PDF online. I'll link it below.</p>
